#Sentiment Analysis of Live Audio 

1) Assembly AI
- This can be achieved by multiple ways, Assembly Ai is one of the solution where we can run a python code and get the sentiment of each sentence with its :

    {
      "text": "I mean, I try to work out as much of it in sports, but I still have a lot left over for my real business, so.",
      "start": 28990,
      "end": 36390,
      "sentiment": "NEUTRAL",
      "confidence": 0.7168238162994385,
      "speaker": null
    }
	
2) This can be achieved in two parts:
	(a)	- we can upload the audio file on the Assembly AI cloud, using a python code, file - "UploadAAudioFile_to_AssemblyAI".
		- This code will return the url of uploaded file, which will be imported in another python code.
		
	(b) - running the code to transcript the audio file and to give the start, end index along with sentiment, confidence and speaker.
		- File to run python code is: AssemblyAI_AudioSentimentAnalysis
		
# Sentiment analysis of audio ca also be achieved using python library "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer" with google's speech recognition
		- For this we have prepared and tested the code, File "SentimentIntensityAnalyzer"
		- This code runs on live audio. 
		- Output of the code file is like:
			waiting for your message...
			Done recording
			printing the message...
			Your message:hi this is Harish Sharma are you listening
			{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}
